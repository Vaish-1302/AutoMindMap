Build a full-stack MERN application called AutoMindMap with the following requirements:

🔐 Authentication & Database (Supabase)

Use Supabase for user authentication and database storage.

Users should be able to:

Register with username, email, password, and confirm password.

Login with email and password.

On successful login, redirect to the Home page.

Store user details (username, email, password hash) in Supabase.

Store AI-generated summaries in Supabase with real-time updates.

🤖 Gemini API Integration (Summarization + Explanation)

In the Navbar, include a “New Summary” button.

Clicking it opens a popup where user pastes a YouTube video link.

On Generate Summary, call the Gemini API to generate a detailed note-style summary of the video.

Save the summary in Supabase with fields:

summaryId (unique ID)

title

date/time

video link

video duration

AI-generated summary (detailed notes)

After generation, redirect the user to the Summary Page.

Additional AI Feature:

If a student selects any line/paragraph in the summary, the system should call Gemini API again to re-explain that portion in simpler words.

🔊 Text-to-Speech Feature

Add a Text-to-Speech (TTS) option so that summaries can be listened to as audio.

Implement a play/pause button inside the Summary Page.

💳 Subscription System (Premium Features)

Free users: Can generate summaries, view history, and bookmarks.

Premium users:

Access Group Chat (chatroom where subscribed students can discuss summaries).

Unlimited explanations (paragraph re-explain feature).

Higher quota of summaries per day.

Implement a subscription model (can be simulated via Supabase user roles for now).
